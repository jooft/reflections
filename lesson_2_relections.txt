What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
creates metadata for the git structure/framework, to use the git system to
take advantage of its version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
the staging area is the area where you build the logical/modular commits
the working directory is all the files you are working on/change (or sometimes
not)
the repository is everything together

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
running git diff with no args and then adding/removing to make sure you commit in
logical blocks

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?
testing new features, big updates
branches would help by saving working versions before new experimental changes or large changes
are made
