When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Multiple users, access multiple pcs, share with the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so you dont share things that you arent ready to release/share

Describe the differences betwween forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?
fork - taking someone elses repo and making a version for you to edit in your user repos
clone - copying a repo (yours, local/remote)
branch - inside a repo, two or more version chains of the repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
less to merge? not sure what else. fast-forward merge?
